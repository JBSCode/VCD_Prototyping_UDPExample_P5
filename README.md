VCD Prototyping Processing Demo
===============

This is a quick demonstration how to use the Arduino/Ethernet interface.

The datastructure of each UDP packet is very simple: 32 bytes sent to 192.168.0.177:8888
Each Byte defines the intensity of one LCD.

The controller software + more information can be found here:
